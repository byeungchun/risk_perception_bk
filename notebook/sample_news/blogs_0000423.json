REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi\nGabriele Angeli, 34, and Gabriele Stampa, 43, are founders of Florence-based Bitminer Factory, Italy’s largest currency-mining host, which has developed a computer “rig” they hope will underpin a plan to forge a unusual business model.\nMining cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin requires the use of powerful computers to solve complex problems to complete, verify and record transactions in these virtual currencies. In return, miners are issued with new units of cryptocurrency as a reward.\nIn eight months of operation, the “Bitminer 8” has helped to attract 140 miners to their mining operation on the outskirts of the elegant Renaissance city, which for several centuries from the Middle Ages served as a mint for European coinage.\nTheir next step, using the proceeds of their initial coin offering, is to take the Bitminer 8 on the road, installing the machines in shipping containers and enabling miners to move them by truck to cheap power sources across Europe.\n“With the mobile farm we want to conquer Europe,” Angeli said. “It will allow us to export our business model which we’ve been experimenting with here in Florence.” Gabriele Stampa, Alberto and Gabriele Angeli (R-L), the founders of the Bitminer Factory, pose with a client, Antonio Mazzitelli, in Florence, Italy, April 6, 2018. Picture taken April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi\nThe enterprise is built on the Bitminer 8 machine, which began as a prototype assembled in a dishwasher drawer from off-the-shelf computer parts. It is aimed at those targeting currencies other than Bitcoin, the most challenging to mine.\nBitcoin mining needs more computational power and energy than other cryptocurrencies and the supply of Bitcoin rigs is dominated by large manufacturers such as China’s Bitmain Technologies and Canaan Creative, and U.S.-based Bitfury.\nBy contrast, miners of other cryptocurrencies require less sophisticated rigs, and the market is more open to smaller firms like Bitminer, whose modern-day Florentine mint is powered by renewable energy and housed in a drab industrial building.\nAngeli said he and his business partner planned to use the proceeds of their fund-raising to open a new mining center in southern Italy this year, and push into what they call “mobile farms”, rigs that are housed inside shipping containers.
